        <b><u>Upgrades</u></b>
        <p>An upgrade is the act of replacing your product with a newer, and often more superior, version or 
            
            similar product. Therefore, an update modifies your current product while an upgrade totally 
            replaces it. When it comes to the frequency, upgrades happen a lot less often compared to updates.</p>

        <b><u>Patch</u></b>
        <p>A software patch or fix is a quick-repair job for a piece of programming designed to resolve 
            functionality issues, improve security and add new features. Throughout its lifetime, software will run 
            into problems called bugs. A patch is the immediate fix to those problems. IT or end users can often 
            download a patch from the software maker's website. The patch is not necessarily the best fix for the 
            problem, and the product's developers often find a more thorough option when they package the 
            software for its next release. </p>

    <b><u>Automatic</u></b>
        <p>You can turn off automatic updates but it is not advisable. Many of them will be minor tweaks and 
            fixes for problems that probably won't affect you but in amongst the routine updates there are usually 
            important or critical security patches</p>

        <b><u>Compatibility</u></b>
        <p>Compatibility is the capacity for two systems to work together without having to be altered to do so. 
            Compatible software applications use the same data formats. For example, if word processor 
            applications are compatible, the user should be able to open their document files in either product. </p>
